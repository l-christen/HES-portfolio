I did not participate much in the discussion because I let the SCRUM master lead the discussion and show the work already done. This showed my ability to stay in the background when it is necessary in order to not create confusion.\n\n\nMeeting with the customers\nThis meeting was very important to understand the needs of the customers. Our product is an application that allow patients to record medical signals at home during their sleep to analyse their sleep quality (apnea, sleep phases, etc.) and their heart health. We noticed that the customers are more interested in the data our app could generate than in the app itself. It helped to know that we need to focus on the data storage and analysis. At this point, I am more aware of the projects requirements but I am impatient to meet the medical data professional.\n\n\nDaily meetings\nWe had daily meetings with the whole team every morning. I invest myself in these meetings by sharing my work and asking questions. I will not talk about it anymore if there is no specific point to highlight, since it is a daily routine."

For now, the documentation is not very structured and very incomplete because we need to get more information about the D-Heart device. For now, I am waiting for the sensor team to continue the documentation about the D-Heart device.\nAt this point, I need to write a section about the ECG signal and how to interpret it because I am convinced that understanding the data you are working with is crucial to be able to work with it.\n\n\nAttempt to get data from the D-Heart device without the official software\nSince the sensing device is(was) a black box, I tried to connect to it without using the official software. I was able to connect to the device and get some data, but I don’t know how to interpret it yet. I think that I am able to get the values for each electrode, but I don’t know which value corresponds to which electrode and I don’t know how much noise removal is provided by the device before sending the data. This has to be figured out by the sensor team as soon as they get documentation from the manufacturer.\n\n\nECG Data and machine learning\nI started read papers about ECG data and machine learning. I am trying to see what is feasible with the kind of data we have knowing that we have only 8 leads and the data processing has to be done on device. I have started reporting what I have learned. I think that the interest in others papers is good for our project but I am not sure if it is relevant to report it in the documentation because it is not directly related to our project. I will maybe not continue this report, keep interesting myself in the papers about ECG processing and machine learning but not report it and start making my own experiments with the data I could find there for example. I need to discuss this with my data science team and the SCRUM master to see if it is relevant."
